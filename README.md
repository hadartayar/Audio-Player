**Description:
**
The audio looper is composed of rows, each row represents a sound segment. Each row has a mute button that allows the user to disable a specific sound. In addition, there are three buttons on the audio player:**
- Play/pause button.
- Stop button that pauses the music and also resetting the sound clips.
- Loop button that gives the option to hear the sound clips over and over again.

**Another feature the audio looper has is the cursor. The cursor points to the current time of the soundtrack and lets the user change the current time of the playback by drag and drop functionality.**
