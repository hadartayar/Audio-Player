**The audio looper is composed of colorful rows, each row represents a sound segment. 
Each row has a mute button that allows the user to disable a specific soundtrack. 
In addition, there are three buttons on the audio looper:**

- Play/Pause buttons - play or pause the soundtracks.
- Stop button - pauses the music and also resetting the soundtracks.
- Loop button - the option to hear the soundtracks over and over again.

**Another feature the audio looper has is the cursor (the progress bar). 
The progress bar points to the current time of the soundtrack and lets the user change the current time of the sounds by clicking on the progress bar.**
